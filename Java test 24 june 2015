Core Java Test Questions
                                        
Please Answer the below questions briefly:
1.	What is the most important feature of java?
most important feature of java:
1.Write Once Run Anywhere.
2.It is purely an Object oriented language.
3.Everything is considered as an Object.
4.It have pre defined classes and Functionalities.
5.Multithreading
6.Exception Handling.
7.It has  platform independent byte code to run on any JVM installed machine.
8.Simple
2.	What do you mean by platform independent?
Java is platform independent because when a java program is complied it is converted into platform independent byte code , that is interprted by JVM and converts to the 
3.	What is the difference between JVM,JDK and JRE?
JDK : Java development kit it physically exits, which contains JVM and developments tools and Api.
JVM: Java is an Acronym for Java virtual Machine. It is a abstract machine which converts the machine code into Run time environment in the platform which the JVM is installed.it helps to execute byte file into class file.
JRE: JRE stands  for the Java run time environment  that run application on any platform or os 

4.	What is the concept called Pointers? And does java supports Pointer?
Pointers concepts are used in c which handles the memory  and interact with the machine very powerfully.  But  Java does not support pointers concept.
5.	What is the base class of all the classes?
Object is the base class of all the classes.
6.	What do you mean by local variables?
1.local variables are declared inside the method, constructors or blocks.
2.local variables cannot have default value, it should be initialized.
3.local variables cannot accessed by modifiers.
4.local variables cannot be static.
5.Local variables are destroyed when the method, constructors or blocks are exited.
7.	What do you mean by Class Variables?
Class variables are called as static variables declared inside the class with the static keyword.

8.	Can you explain: public static void main(String args[])
Public  - keyword to access all over the world.
Static- keyword
Void – main () method does not return any value.
(String args)- considered everything as string 
9.	Can main method to be overloaded?

10.	Can a Class declared as protected?
Yes class can be declared as protected in  the same class, other class other package  or sub class  other package.

11.	I don’t want my class to be inherited by other classes. What should I do?
Class should be predefined by Final keyword. So it cannot be extended or subclassed or inherited.
12.	What is the purpose of declaring variable as final?’

If the variable is declared as final .The value cannot be change.It can be a constant.
 	
13.	What is the impact of declaring a method as final?
If the method is declared as final the mathode cannot be over rided by the subclasses.
14.	What is an abstract class and what is the purpose?
If abstract keyword is predefined in class it is called abstract class.
No implementation. 
If any of the method is abstract then we should declare the class as abstract.
It should be extended in future or by some one 
A obj1 = new B();
The purpose  of abstract is to hide the internal methods of the system 
Eg.phone call. We know how to make a call in mobile but we don’t know the internal system how the   mobile makes a call.
15.	Can a abstract class defines as final?
No, final and abstract class cannot be together. 
Because Abstract should  be extended by some one . But final cannot extended or subclassed.
16.	Can you create object for abstract class
        No object cannot be created for same class. 
It can be created as A obj1 = new B();
17.	What is the use of instanceof operator?
The instance of the operator is used to check whether the object belongs to the instance of the class or variable.
18.	What is an abstract method?
The method predefined by abstract keyword.
The abstract method is simple a skeleton without any implementation inside the method.
It should be implemented in future.
19.	What are the different types of if statements available?
1.if ()….
2. else if()…..
3.else…
4. nested if else….
20.	Please explain about all access modifiers in java?
Access 
modifiers
	
Same class	Other class
Same package	Other class
Other package	Subclass
Other package
Default 	yes	yes	no	no
Public
	yes	yes	yes	yes
private	yes	no	no	no
protected	yes	yes	yes	no

Please Write Programs for below scenario:
1.Getting three inputs from the user and displaying which one is greater one.
import.java.util.io;
class  GreaterOne
{
Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(“Enter the value for a :”);
int a = scan.nextInt();
System.out.println(“Enter the value for b :”);
int b = scan.nextInt();
System.out.println(“Enter the value for c :”);
int c = scan.nextInt();
     


   if (a>b)
{  
         if (a>c)
                {
                      System.out.println(“the greater value is ”,+a);
                  }
         else
                 {
                        System.out.println(“the greater value is ”,+c);
                   }
}
else  	{
	              if (b>c)
                                     {
                                         System.out.println(“the greater value is ”,+b);
                                     }
		else
		      { 
                             System.out.println(“The greater value is :”+c)
                                    }
    }

                           public static void main(String args[])
}

2.Student Marks grade system.
class Grade
{ 
                     public static void main(String args[])
{

          if (A>=90)
           {
	System.out.println(“Grade is : O”);
           }
         else if (A>=80)
         {
	System.out.println(“Grade is : A+”);
           }
         else if (A>=70)
        {
	System.out.println(“Grade is : A”);
         }
         else if (A>=60)
       {
	System.out.println(“Grade is : B”);
        }
else if (A>=40)
     	{
	System.out.println(“Grade is : C”);
              }
else 
          {	
                System.out.println(“You are fail”);
           }
     }
}
3.sample program for abstract class and method concept?
class Brids
{
abstract void sound()
     {
     }
void name()
      {
      	System.out.println(“”);
      }
}
public static void main(String args[])
Birds ob1 = new music();
obj1.name();

4.Sample program for swapping two variables without using third variable?

All the Best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
